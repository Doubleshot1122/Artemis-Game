# Artemis - G48 Quarter 3 Project

## What is Artemis?

Artemis is a mobile scavenger hunt application for Android devices, developed and designed by G48 Web Developments students Donny Barclay, Joshua Warren, and Summer Barclay.

As all three of our team members are new to the area, the idea of Artemis came to us as a way to meet new people, explore your surroundings, and get in some exercise. Intuitive acessibility between the various features was our main priorities when designing the interface.

### Features

Users can quickly create a new game, entering in their own clues and hints, invite users to a newly created game, accept invitations for upcoming games, view details on accepted hunts, or join an in-progress hunt.

<!-- This is an addon starter template for the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/).

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. It is missing the Ionic library, and AngularJS.

To use this, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy and paste this into an existing Cordova project and download a release of Ionic separately.

### With the Ionic tool:

Take the name after `ionic-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myApp tabs
```

Then, to run it, cd into `myApp` and run:

```bash
$ ionic platform add ios
$ ionic build ios
$ ionic emulate ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac, but if you can, the ios development toolchain is a lot easier to work with until you need to do anything custom to Android.
