# Artemis - G48 Quarter 3 Project

## What is Artemis?

Artemis is a mobile scavenger hunt application for Android devices, developed and designed by G48 Web Developments students Donny Barclay, Joshua Warren, and Summer Barclay.

As all three of our team members are new to the area, the idea of Artemis came to us as a way to meet new people, explore your surroundings, and get in some exercise. Intuitive acessibility between the various features was our main priorities when designing the interface.

### Features

Users can quickly create a new game, entering in their own clues and hints, invite users to a newly created game, accept invitations for upcoming games, view details on accepted hunts, or join an in-progress hunt.
